**Boonoo's Song Printer** is a Chrome extension to print out the lyrics of any song on the Spotify web player to a handheld thermal printer (Phomemo T02).

1. Visit the single song webpage for any track on [open.spotify.com](open.spotify.com)
2. Click the "Preview & Print" button on the top of the page.
3. The extension will scrape song data from the Spotify page and lyric data from Google to generate a black and white _song receipt_ to be printed.
4. **Optional**: Manually edit or enter different song lyrics.
5. Click the "Print" button at the top of the popout to connect the thermal printer via Bluetooth and start printing!
